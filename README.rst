=============

.. |travis| image:: https://travis-ci.org/ruslo/ansible-rust.svg?branch=master
  :target: https://travis-ci.org/ruslo/ansible-rust/builds

Ansible role for Installing Rust on Linux using ``.tar.gz`` archives instead
of ``rustup.sh`` script.

Requirements
------------

TODO: Any pre-requisites that may not be covered by Ansible itself or the role should be mentioned here. For instance, if the role uses the EC2 module, it may be a good idea to mention in this section that the boto package is required.

Role Variables
--------------

TODO: A description of the settable variables for this role should go here, including any variables that are in defaults/main.yml, vars/main.yml, and any variables that can/should be set via parameters to the role. Any variables that are read from other roles and/or the global scope (ie. hostvars, group vars, etc.) should be mentioned here as well.

Example Playbook
----------------

TODO: Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: username.rolename, x: 42 }
